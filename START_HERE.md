## 🎯 Common Scenarios & Solutions

### "The AI isn't responding!"
**Solution:** 
- The app works WITHOUT an API key using fallback responses
- If fallback isn't working, check console for errors
- Worst case: Explain the feature and show the code

### "I'm nervous about presenting"
**Read:** AUDIENCE_FRIENDLY_GUIDE.md section on "Energy Management"
**Remember:** You built something cool. The hard part is done!

### "They're asking technical questions"
**If you know:** Answer confidently
**If you don't:** "Great question! I'd need to check [specific detail], but the architecture supports it."

### "Demo is running slow"
**Before presenting:** Restart server, clear cache
**During presenting:** "Sometimes live demos lag - let me show you the result" [show screenshot or explain]

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Impact
Don't start with "Hi, so I built this menu..." 
Start with "Watch this..." then immediately show the AI responding to a question.

### Tip 2: Use Their Context
Presenting to a restaurant owner? Say "Imagine your restaurant..."
Presenting to developers? Say "The architecture uses..."
Presenting to investors? Say "The market opportunity is..."

### Tip 3: Let Them Try It
Best presentations are interactive. After your demo, say:
> "Here, you try it - ask the AI anything about the menu."

### Tip 4: Have a Backup
If the live demo fails:
- Have screenshots ready
- Be able to explain what SHOULD happen
- Stay calm (technical glitches happen!)

### Tip 5: End with Action
Don't end with "So yeah, that's it."
End with "Want to try it yourself? Here's the link..."
