## 🎬 Variations for Different Audiences

### For Restaurant Owners (Business Focus):

**Opening:**
> "This system solves your biggest menu problem: customers with dietary restrictions. Here's how..."

**During AI demo:**
> "This AI is like having an extra server who never gets tired and knows your entire menu perfectly."

**Closing:**
> "Cost? Under $30 a month. Compare that to one lost sale from a confused customer."

---

### For Developers (Tech Focus):

**Opening:**
> "Built with vanilla JavaScript and Node.js - no heavy frameworks. Let me show you what it can do..."

**During demo:**
> "Notice the responsive design, smooth animations, and instant state updates."

**Closing:**
> "All the code is clean, documented, and ready for your customization. Want to see the architecture?"

---

### For Investors (Business Focus):

## 📝 Audience Questions (Be Ready)

### Expected Questions:

**Q: "Does it really need AI?"**  
A: "AI makes it special - customers can ask natural questions instead of hunting through filters. But it also works without AI using smart fallback responses."

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**  
A: "To run? About $5-30 per month depending on whether you use the AI API. To buy? It's free and open-source."

**Q: "Can it integrate with our POS system?"**  
A: "Yes! The API is designed to connect with most systems. We'd need to set up a custom integration."

**Q: "What about different languages?"**  
A: "Not built-in yet, but the architecture supports it. We could add multi-language in about a week."

**Q: "Is it secure?"**  
A: "Yes, follows standard web security practices. If you need payment processing, we integrate with Stripe which is PCI compliant."
